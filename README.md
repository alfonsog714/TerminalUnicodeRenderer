A small side-project I made following along "Code-It-Yourself! First Person Shooter (Quick and Simple C++)" by javidx9. 
The method of rendering used here is [ray casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting), a choice that was inspired by [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D).
